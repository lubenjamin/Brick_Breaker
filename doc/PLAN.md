# Game Plan
## Benjamin Lu (bll32)


### Breakout Variant

A variant of breakout that I focus on
is the version I used to play on the BlackBerry. In the BlackBerry variant
the same general concept of destroying all bricks to progress to the next level.
A unique function this variant are the paddle power-ups. Upon destroying
certain bricks the paddle may be granted power-ups such as the ability to shoot
lasers or missiles to help destroy bricks faster. However, for the sake of 
time paddle power-ups seem too complex to be implemented and instead power-ups
will be more focused on changing characteristics of the ball. 

### General Level Descriptions

The further the player gets the more difficult levels become. Level one
is the easiest level by only including blocks that are destroyed in one 
hit. The second level will be similar to the first but blocks that require 
multiple hits will be incorporated. The final level will include the same bricks
in addition to bricks that are indestructible. The purpose of multi-hit 
bricks and indestructible bricks is to have levels last longer testing
the endurance of the player. 

### Bricks Ideas
Bricks will have varying amount of hits required to be destroyed. There will 
be specialty bricks that cannot be destroyed and others that will
grant power ups or extra lives when destroyed. 

### Power Up Ideas  

Power-ups are collected by destroying bricks. Power-ups persist for the rest of the level and reset 
on the next level. The following are several power-ups:

power - grant the power of each hit with a brick to increase

enlarge - increase the size of the main ball

speed - increase the speed of the main ball


### Cheat Key Ideas

Cheat codes are meant to be hidden triggers that give the players 
advantages when triggered. The current plan is to have cheat keys be
activated when the correct key is pressed during the game. The following
are several cheat keys:

Z - pressing Z will reset the level and make all bricks destructible with one hit

1 - pressing 1 will start the first level regardless of the current level

2 - pressing 2 will start the second level regardless of the current level

3 - pressing 3 will start the third level regardless of the current level

R - pressing R will reset the level

### Something Extra

The extra addition I plan to add is an end-game screen. This screen will appear
either on the completion of all three levels or when the player loses
all lives. Statistics will also be displayed on the screen such as 
the amount of bricks destroyed and how many paddle hits occurred during 
the game session. The end screen will also prompt the player to click the mouse
to restart the game. I believe this a substantial addition because
it requires the program to keep a running track of certain statistics 
and it provides a nice clear gateway from the end of the game back to the 
start of the game. If this extra feature is completed easily a potential 
upgrade is modifying it into a leader-board type of feature where
the highest scores and names are recorded.
